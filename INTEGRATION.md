## Advanced Options

```html
<script>
  window.AvenixConfig = { debug: true };
</script>
<script src="https://avenix-pixel.vercel.app/pixel.js"></script>
```

### Option 2: Async Loading (Best Performance)
```html
<script>
  (function() {
    var s = document.createElement('script');
    s.src = 'https://avenix-pixel.vercel.app/pixel.js';
    s.async = true;
    document.head.appendChild(s);
  })();
</script>
```
